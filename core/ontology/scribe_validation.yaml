description: "Empirical validation and benchmarking of Scribe Fusion Transformer against MiniLM baseline"

purpose: |
  Scribe Validation provides empirical testing of the Scribe Fusion Transformer's ability to 
  compose coherent Wisp embeddings from multimodal inputs. Tests measure composition latency, 
  semantic coherence, fidelity to target embeddings, and compare performance against MiniLM baseline.

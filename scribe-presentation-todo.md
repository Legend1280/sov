# Scribe Presentation Project - TODO

## Phase 1: Documentation Analysis
- [x] Read and extract principles from Scribe model README
- [x] Read and extract principles from training dataset README
- [x] Read and extract principles from validation report PDF
- [x] Identify all key concepts: fusion, coherence, multi-head attention, semantic power
- [x] Map concepts to measurable metrics
- [x] Document visual representation strategy for each concept

## Phase 2: Visual Language & Ontology
- [x] Design fusion visualization (4 modalities â†’ Wisp)
- [x] Design attention heatmap visualization
- [x] Design statistical power charts
- [x] Design semantic drift visualization
- [x] Create scribe_presentation.yaml ontology definition
- [x] Define all UI components in ontology
- [x] Define all events and data flows

## Phase 3: Batch Validation Service
- [x] Extend scribe_validation_service.py for batch processing
- [x] Add batch sizes: 10, 50, 100, 200 samples
- [x] Implement statistical analysis (mean, std, t-tests, effect sizes)
- [x] Add confidence interval calculations
- [x] Add attention pattern extraction
- [x] Add semantic power metrics
- [x] Test batch processing performance

## Phase 4: Dynamic Visualizations
- [ ] Build real-time fusion animation (Viewport 1)
- [ ] Build multi-head attention heatmap (Viewport 1)
- [ ] Build statistical power charts (Viewport 2)
- [ ] Build semantic drift visualization (Viewport 2)
- [ ] Build coherence distribution plots (Viewport 2)
- [ ] Add smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Ensure all visualizations update in real-time

# Upload Button Implementation Summary

## Executive Overview

The **Ontological Upload Button** has been successfully implemented as a fully functional file ingestion bridge between Mirror (UI) and Core (semantic kernel). This implementation transforms the Sovereignty Stack from a read-only visualization system into an active semantic memory platform.

## What Was Built

### 1. UploadHandler Component (`mirror/client/src/components/UploadHandler.tsx`)

A sophisticated React component that handles the complete upload workflow:

**Core Capabilities:**
- Native file picker integration
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, Pages, XLSX, CSV, images, JSON, XML)
- Automatic MIME type detection
- Base64 encoding for binary file transmission
- Real-time upload status tracking
- Auto-dismissing success/error notifications
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses React hooks (useState, useRef) for state management
- FileReader API for client-side file processing
- Fetch API for HTTP communication with Core
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistency

### 2. Core API Ingestion Endpoint (`core/core_api.py`)

A new FastAPI endpoint at `POST /api/ingest` that processes uploaded files:

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Decode**: Convert base64 content back to binary
2. **Hash**: Compute SHA-256 hash for provenance integrity
3. **Classify**: Determine ontology type from MIME type
4. **Ingest**: Create semantic object using Core reasoner
5. **Validate**: Run SAGE coherence and trust scoring
6. **Record**: Generate provenance event with full metadata
7. **Respond**: Return structured JSON with object details

**Semantic Features:**
- Ontology-aware type classification (Document, Image, Spreadsheet)
- Provenance tracking with actor, timestamp, and content hash
- SAGE validation integration (when available)
- Graceful fallback for undefined ontology types
- JSON sanitization for safe serialization

### 3. MirrorLayout Integration (`mirror/client/src/components/MirrorLayout.tsx`)

Seamless integration into the existing Mirror interface:

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced non-functional Upload button with UploadHandler component
- Added state management for uploaded objects
- Implemented callback handlers for success/error events
- Auto-open SurfaceViewer on successful upload
- Console logging for debugging and verification

**Design Principles:**
- Maintains minimal aesthetic of Mirror framework
- Preserves existing layout and spacing
- Consistent with temporal controls styling
- Non-intrusive notification placement

## Key Features

### Ontology Awareness

Every uploaded file becomes a **semantic object** with:
- **Type**: Automatically classified (Document, Image, Spreadsheet)
- **Provenance**: Complete audit trail with actor and timestamp
- **Hash**: SHA-256 content hash for integrity verification
- **Validation**: SAGE coherence and trust scoring

### Supported File Types

| Category | Formats | Ontology Type |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Documents | PDF, DOC, DOCX, Pages, TXT | Document |
| Spreadsheets | XLS, XLSX, CSV | Spreadsheet |
| Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG | Image |
| Data | JSON, XML | Document |

### User Experience

**Upload Flow:**
1. Click "Upload" button → File picker opens
2. Select file → Processing begins
3. Button shows "Uploading..." → User feedback
4. Success notification → Confirmation message
5. SurfaceViewer opens → Object details displayed

**Error Handling:**
- "Core API unreachable" - Service not running
- "Unsupported file format" - Invalid file type
- "Invalid base64 content" - Encoding failure
- "Ingestion failed" - Server-side error

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side (Mirror)

```typescript
// File selection
<input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />

// Processing
const contentBase64 = await fileToBase64(file);

// API call
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8001/api/ingest', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

// State update
setUploadedObject(result);
```

### Server-Side (Core)

```python
# Endpoint
@app.post("/api/ingest")
def ingest_file(request: FileIngestRequest):
    # Decode
    content_bytes = base64.b64decode(request.content_base64)
    
    # Hash
    content_hash = hashlib.sha256(content_bytes).hexdigest()
    
    # Ingest
    reasoned = reasoner.ingest(ontology_type, document_data, "MirrorUser")
    
    # Respond
    return JSONResponse(response)
```

### Data Flow

```
User → File Picker → UploadHandler → Base64 Encoding → 
HTTP POST → Core API → Reasoner → Ontology → SAGE → 
Provenance → Response → Mirror State → SurfaceViewer
```

## Semantic Principles Implemented

### 1. Memory as Ethical Act

Every upload is treated as a **semantic act of memory**, not mere data storage:
- Files become ontological objects with meaning
- Provenance tracks who, what, when, and why
- Content hashing ensures integrity and trust

### 2. Ontology-First Design

The system doesn't just store files; it **understands** them:
- Automatic type classification based on content
- Semantic relationships to other objects
- Vector embeddings for similarity search (future)

### 3. Provenance as Foundation

Every action is recorded for accountability:
- Actor: Who performed the upload (MirrorUser)
- Timestamp: When it occurred (ISO 8601)
- Hash: What was uploaded (SHA-256)
- Source: Where it came from (MirrorUpload)

## Testing & Verification

## Preamble

We, the architects of the Core Semantic OS, establish this constitution to guide the principles of its design, development, and evolution. This document canonizes the foundational truths of the system, ensuring that all future extensions, viewers, and applications adhere to a unified, ontology-first architecture.

---

## Article I: The First Principle - Ontology as Truth

### Section 1: The Primacy of Ontology
The ultimate source of truth within the system is the **Ontology**. All data, without exception, shall be represented as ontological objects. The schema of the system IS the ontology, not a separate database definition.

### Section 2: Structure and Inheritance
All objects shall inherit from the `core.Object` base type, which mandates the existence of an ID, timestamps, a vector representation, and a provenance trail. New object types shall be defined by extending the base ontology, not by creating ad-hoc data structures.

### Section 3: Semantic Relationships
Relationships between objects are semantic, not merely foreign keys. The meaning of these relationships shall be defined within the ontology (e.g., `is_a`, `relates_to`, `contains`).

### Section 4: Validation
All objects created or modified within the system must be validated against the ontology. Objects that fail validation are considered non-canonical and shall not be persisted.

---

## Article II: The Second Principle - Provenance as Immutability

### Section 1: The Right to a Story
Every object has a right to its own creation story. All operations that create, modify, or delete an object shall be recorded as immutable `Event` objects in the provenance log.

### Section 2: Traceability
The provenance trail provides a complete, auditable history of every object. This ensures that the truth of the system is not only defined but also traceable.

### Section 3: No Silent Mutations
There shall be no silent or untracked modifications to any object. All changes must be recorded as a new provenance event.

---

## Article III: The Third Principle - Vectors as Meaning

### Section 1: Semantic Representation
Every object shall have a vector representation that captures its semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space. This ensures that all objects are queryable by meaning, not just by properties.

### Section 2: Similarity as a First-Class Operation
Semantic similarity search is a first-class operation within the system. The Core API shall provide a robust, efficient mechanism for finding objects based on vector similarity.

### Section 3: Emergent Intelligence
Intelligence within the system (e.g., forecasting, pattern detection, anomaly detection) shall emerge from the relationships between object vectors, not from hardcoded rules or business logic.

---

## Article IV: The Fourth Principle - Standard Operations Enabled

### Section 1: Pragmatism within the Framework
The ontology-first approach enables, but does not constrain, standard data operations. The system shall provide efficient mechanisms for filtering, sorting, and aggregating objects based on their properties.

### Section 2: The Hybrid Model
The system shall support a hybrid query model:
- **Standard Queries:** For fast, deterministic operations (e.g., `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`).
- **Semantic Queries:** For intelligent, contextual operations (e.g., similarity search, pattern detection).

### Section 3: Ontology as Enabler
The ontology defines what things ARE, but the API enables how you work with them. The system shall provide a rich set of tools for both standard and semantic interaction with ontological objects.

---

## Article V: Implementation and Governance

### Section 1: The Ontology Validator
The `OntologyValidator` is the guardian of this constitution. It shall be used to enforce the principles of ontology-first design in all Core API operations.

### Section 2: Extending the Ontology
Extensions to the ontology shall be made by creating new `.yaml` files that extend the base ontology. These extensions must adhere to the principles laid out in this constitution.

### Section 3: The Core API
The Core API is the sole gatekeeper to the ontological truth of the system. All viewers and applications shall interact with the system through the Core API.

## Ratification

This constitution is hereby ratified and adopted as the supreme law of the Core Semantic OS. All future development shall be bound by its principles.

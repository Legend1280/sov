## 1. Executive Summary

This document marks the transition from the v5.x series to the v6.0 development cycle. The v5.x series focused on foundational backend enhancements, including the integration of a vector database, the implementation of a robust provenance tracking system, and a significant refactoring of the data ingestion pipeline. This work culminated in a stable local development environment where documents can be successfully ingested, processed by language models, and stored.

However, significant issues remain in the data mapping and visualization layers. While the backend now correctly processes and stores data, the frontend does not yet fully render the extracted ontologies, concept relationships, or vector-based insights. The primary goal of the v6.0 cycle will be to bridge this gap, build out the user-facing features described in the "6.0 and Beyond" vision document, and create a truly interactive semantic exploration experience.

This handoff package provides a comprehensive overview of the system's current state, a detailed log of the development work completed in the v5.x series, and a clear roadmap for the features and fixes required to achieve the v6.0 vision.

## 2. Version History (v5.0 â†’ v5.9)

*The following semantic versions have been retroactively assigned to document the development progress throughout the conversation thread.*

### **v5.0: Provenance & Planet View** (Baseline)
- **Feature:** Production-ready Provenance Tracking System with event logging for ingestion, extraction, and summarization.
- **Feature:** Enhanced Planet View with smooth camera controls and synchronized zoom states.
- **Architecture:** Established a clear frontend/backend separation with Vercel and Railway deployments.

### **v5.1: Local Environment & Initial Fixes**
- **Fix:** Corrected hardcoded Railway URL in the frontend upload form to use a dynamic `BACKEND_URL`.
- **Fix:** Updated `config.js` to point to the new Render production URL, completing the migration from Railway.
- **Chore:** Established a stable local development workflow with separate terminals for frontend and backend servers.

### **v5.2: Database Schema & Migration**
- **Feature:** Introduced a database migration system (`migrate_local.py`).
- **Fix:** Added the `provenance_events` table and `summary` columns to the SQLite schema to resolve ingestion failures.
- **Fix:** Resolved critical `no such table: provenance_events` error during document processing.

### **v5.3: Backend Stability & Configuration**
- **Fix:** Lazy-loaded the OpenAI client in `extractor.py` to prevent backend crashes on startup when an API key was not present.
- **Fix:** Synchronized `DB_PATH` logic between `api.py` and `extractor.py` to resolve `unable to open database file` errors by ensuring both modules referenced the same database file in the project root.
- **Chore:** Documented the need for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for local development.

### **v5.4: API & Endpoint Debugging**
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging to the `/tree` endpoint, resolving an issue where it would return an empty `[]` response despite documents being present in the database.
- **Fix:** Corrected a bug in the `add_provenance_status()` function that was causing it to fail silently and suppress the document list.

### **v5.5: Core Ingestion Pipeline Success**
- **Feature:** Achieved the first successful end-to-end document ingestion in the local environment.
- **Confirmation:** Verified that uploaded documents are correctly processed, stored in the SQLite database, and listed by the `/tree` endpoint.
- **Status:** Marks the successful completion of the backend data persistence layer.

### **v5.6: Vector Provenance & Search (Partially Implemented)**
- **Feature:** Added schema columns for `vector`, `vector_fingerprint`, `vector_model`, and `vector_dimension` to `documents` and `concepts` tables.
- **Feature:** Integrated ChromaDB as a secondary storage for vector embeddings.
- **Issue:** Vector provenance chain is "Broken" and not logging events, indicating a failure in the embedding or logging pipeline.
- **Issue:** Semantic search is not yet functional as embeddings are not being generated or queried correctly.

### **v5.7: MiniLM Integration & Summarization (Planned)**
- **Architecture:** Defined a new "MiniLM-First" ingestion pipeline to handle summaries and embeddings locally before passing to GPT for ontology extraction.
- **Issue:** This pipeline is not yet implemented. Current system still relies entirely on GPT for all post-ingestion processing.

### **v5.8: Visualization & UI (Broken)**
- **Issue:** The Solar System and Planet Views do not render concept nodes for newly ingested documents, despite the data being present in the backend.
- **Issue:** The UI shows "Concepts: 0, Relations: 0" and document summaries are not displayed, indicating a data mapping failure between the backend API and the frontend components.
- **Error:** A JavaScript error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'flatten')` was identified in `dualVisualizer.js`, preventing the rendering of the orbital/solar system view.

## 3. System Architecture (Current State)

The system has evolved significantly from the v5.0 architecture. The migration to Render for the backend and the introduction of a local-first development approach have clarified the data flows. The planned integration of MiniLM will further modify this architecture.

    end

        M -- Stores --> O[Vector Embeddings];
    end
```

### Data Ingestion Flow (Current)

1.  **Upload:** User uploads files via the frontend UI.
2.  **API Call:** The frontend sends the file to the `/api/ingest/file` endpoint on the FastAPI backend.
3.  **Job Creation:** A background job is created to process the file asynchronously.
4.  **Text Extraction:** The raw text is extracted from the document (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
5.  **Ontology Extraction:** The text is sent to the OpenAI API (GPT-4.1-mini) to extract concepts, relations, and spans. **(This is a current failure point).**
6.  **Storage:** The extracted ontology and document metadata are supposed to be stored in the SQLite database. **(This fails if extraction returns empty).**
7.  **Embedding (Planned):** The document and concepts are supposed to be passed to a local Sentence Transformers model (MiniLM) to generate vector embeddings, which are then stored in ChromaDB. **(This step is not fully implemented and is failing).**
8.  **Provenance Logging:** Events for each step are logged in the `provenance_events` table. **(This is partially working but fails for vector events).**

## 4. Current Issues & Required Fixes for v6.0

The following issues must be addressed to complete the transition to a functional v6.0.

### **P0: Critical - Data Mapping & Visualization**

*   **Symptom:** Newly ingested documents, while present in the database, do not display their concept nodes in the Solar System or Planet views. The UI remains stuck in a loading state or shows an empty graph.
*   **Root Cause:** A combination of two primary failures:
    1.  **Empty Ontology Extraction:** The GPT-4.1-mini extraction process is returning zero concepts and relations. The prompt, the model's response format, or the parsing logic is broken.
    2.  **JavaScript Rendering Error:** The frontend `dualVisualizer.js` contains a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'flatten')`, which crashes the rendering pipeline for the orbital view.
*   **Required Fix:**
    1.  **Debug the Ontology Extraction:** Add intensive logging to the `extractor.py` module. Log the exact prompt being sent to OpenAI and the raw JSON response received. This will determine if the issue is with the prompt or the parsing.
    2.  **Fix the JavaScript Error:** Add defensive coding in `dualVisualizer.js` to handle cases where concept data may be null or in an unexpected format, preventing the crash.

### **P1: High - Vector Embeddings & Provenance**

*   **Symptom:** The Vector Provenance panel shows a "Chain Broken" status with "0 events logged."
*   **Root Cause:** The embedding pipeline, intended to use the local MiniLM model and store vectors in ChromaDB, is not being executed or is failing silently. The provenance events for embedding generation are therefore never logged.
*   **Required Fix:**
    1.  **Implement the MiniLM Pipeline:** Create a dedicated service or module (`minilm_service.py`) that handles the generation of summaries and vector embeddings.
    2.  **Integrate into Ingestion Flow:** Modify the `process_ingestion` function in `api.py` to call this new service after successful text extraction.
    3.  **Implement Vector Provenance:** Add a `log_provenance_event` call specifically for vector generation, capturing the model name, vector dimension, and a hash of the vector to create a valid fingerprint.

### **P2: Medium - Document Summaries**

*   **Symptom:** The "Document summary" panel in the UI is empty.
*   **Root Cause:** The summarization step in the ingestion pipeline is either being skipped due to earlier errors or is failing. The proposed MiniLM pipeline is intended to handle this, but is not yet implemented.
*   **Required Fix:** As part of the MiniLM pipeline implementation, generate a document-level summary and store it in the `summary` column of the `documents` table. Ensure the frontend correctly queries and displays this data.

## Test Summary

All core features of DexaBooks have been tested and verified as working correctly.

---

## Test Results

### ✅ 1. Transaction Management

**Test:** Create individual transactions
```bash
POST /api/transactions
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- Created 17+ transactions successfully
- All validated against financial ontology
- Vector embeddings generated automatically (384-dim)
- Provenance tracked for audit trail

**Sample Transaction:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "ea816085-8bc9-4e01-affe-37e218b5541f",
  "amount": -1500.00,
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "description": "Monthly rent payment",
  "category": "Housing",
  "vendor": "Landlord Inc",
  "is_recurring": true,
  "recurrence_pattern": "monthly",
  "ontology_validated": true
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. CSV Bulk Ingestion

**Test:** Upload CSV file with 10 transactions
```bash
POST /api/ingest/csv
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- 10/10 transactions created (100% success rate)
- Automatic transaction type detection (income vs expense)
- Proper category and vendor parsing
- Zero errors

**Ingested Data:**
- 1 income transaction ($3,500)
- 9 expense transactions (total $1,991.48)
- Categories: Housing, Utilities, Food, Entertainment, Transportation

---

### ✅ 3. Analytics & Reporting

**Test:** Get financial summary
```bash
GET /api/analytics/summary
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
```json
{
  "total_income": 3500.00,
  "total_expenses": 6826.95,
  "net_cash_flow": -3326.95,
  "transaction_count": 17,
  "top_categories": [
    {"category": "Housing", "total": 6000.00},
    {"category": "Utilities", "total": 344.98},
    {"category": "Food", "total": 291.00}
  ]
}
```

**Test:** Get top expenses
```bash
GET /api/analytics/top-expenses?limit=5
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- Correctly sorted by amount (most expensive first)
- Top 3 expenses: All rent payments ($1,500 each)

---

### ✅ 4. Semantic Search

**Test:** Find similar transactions
```bash
POST /api/transactions/{id}/similar
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- Vector-based similarity matching working
- Returns semantically related transactions
- Filters by object_type (Transaction)
- Configurable result limit

---

### ✅ 5. Forecast Generation

**Test:** Generate forecasts for recurring transactions
```bash
POST /api/forecasts/generate?days_ahead=60
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- Generated 6 forecasts automatically
- Based on recurring transaction patterns
- Rule-based forecasting (monthly, weekly, etc.)
- High confidence scores (0.85) for explicit recurrence rules

**Sample Forecast:**
```json
{
  "forecast_id": "0cfa73c5-52c8-41e4-9311-7efb2de3e918",
  "predicted_amount": -1500.00,
  "predicted_date": "2025-11-14",
  "predicted_description": "Monthly rent payment",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "forecast_method": "recurrence_rule",
  "status": "pending",
  "based_on_transactions": ["ea816085-8bc9-4e01-affe-37e218b5541f"]
}
```

---

### ✅ 6. Ontology Validation

**Test:** Verify all objects validated against ontology
```bash
POST /api/core/financial/transaction (with invalid data)
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- Invalid transactions rejected with clear error messages
- Ontology validator enforces schema
- Required properties checked (amount, date, description)
- Type validation working (Number, Date, String, Boolean)

**Fixed Issues:**
- Transaction creation: Added `title` property (inherited from Document)
- Forecast creation: Added `name` property (inherited from Concept)

---

### ✅ 7. Provenance Tracking

**Test:** Check provenance events for created objects
```bash
GET /api/core/provenance/{id}
```

**Result:** SUCCESS
- All transactions have provenance events
- Actor tracked ("dexabooks")
- Event type recorded ("created")
- Metadata preserved (object_type, amount, confidence)
- Immutable audit trail

---

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Transaction Creation Time | ~200-300ms |
| CSV Ingestion (10 records) | ~2-3 seconds |
| Analytics Query Time | ~100-200ms |
| Semantic Search Time | ~200-300ms |
| Forecast Generation (6 forecasts) | ~1-2 seconds |

---

## Architecture Validation

### Ontology-First Principles ✅

1. **Ontology as Truth**
   - All financial objects validated against `/core/ontology/financial_ontology.yaml`
   - Schema IS the ontology
   - No ad-hoc data structures

2. **Provenance as Immutability**
   - Every object has a creation story
   - All operations logged in `provenance_events` table
   - Complete audit trail

3. **Vectors as Meaning**
   - 384-dimensional embeddings for all transactions
   - Semantic search working
   - Similarity queries functional

4. **Standard Operations Enabled**
   - SQL-like filters (date, category, type)
   - Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
   - Sorting and pagination
   - Coexists with semantic operations

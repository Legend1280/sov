## Core Semantic Principles

### 1. **Multimodal Identity Fusion**

**Principle:** Human identity is not a single vector but a **composition of four semantic dimensions** that must be fused while preserving their individual coherence.

**The Four Modalities:**
- **Narrative** (384-dim): The story you tell about yourself - autobiographical memory, personal history, self-concept
- **Modal** (384-dim): How you express yourself - communication style, emotional tone, behavioral patterns
- **Temporal** (384-dim): Your relationship with time - past experiences, present state, future intentions
- **Role** (384-dim): Your social context - relationships, responsibilities, identity in community

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional embedding models (like MiniLM) flatten all context into a single vector, losing the **structural relationships** between these dimensions. Scribe preserves them through learned fusion.

### 2. **Coherence-Preserving Fusion**

**Principle:** Fusion must **not destroy** the semantic information in individual modalities. The fused Wisp should maintain high cosine similarity with each input embedding.

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
Coherence(Wisp, Modality_i) = cosine_similarity(Wisp, Modality_i)
Target: Coherence >= 0.90 for all modalities
```

**Why This Matters:**
If fusion creates a Wisp that is semantically distant from its inputs, it has **hallucinated** new meaning rather than **composed** existing meaning. This is a failure mode.

**Validation Evidence:**
From the validation report:
- Mean coherence: 0.94 ± 0.03 (exceeds 0.90 threshold)
- All modalities preserved in fusion
- No semantic drift detected

---

### 3. **Multi-Head Attention Architecture**

**Principle:** Different aspects of identity require **different attention patterns**. Multi-head attention learns to weight modalities contextually.

**Architecture:**
- 8 attention heads
- Each head learns different fusion strategies
- Heads specialize in different semantic relationships
- Final Wisp is weighted combination of all heads

**Why This Matters:**
A single attention mechanism cannot capture the **complexity of identity composition**. Some contexts require emphasizing narrative (storytelling), others require emphasizing role (social context).

**Example:**
- Personal memory → High narrative attention, low role attention
- Professional introduction → High role attention, moderate modal attention
- Creative fiction → High modal attention, low temporal attention

### 4. **Semantic Power**

**Principle:** Scribe should demonstrate **greater semantic expressiveness** than baseline models when composing multimodal identity.

**Measurable Metrics:**
1. **Coherence**: How well the Wisp preserves input semantics
2. **Distinctiveness**: How well Wisps separate different identities
3. **Compositionality**: How well the Wisp represents the **interaction** of modalities, not just their sum

**Hypothesis:**
Scribe's learned fusion > Simple concatenation > Single-modality baseline

**Test Design:**
- Compare Scribe Wisp vs MiniLM encoding of concatenated text
- Measure coherence, semantic drift, and distinctiveness
- Statistical significance via t-tests

---

### 5. **Training Methodology**

**Principle:** The model learns fusion by **minimizing the distance** between the fused Wisp and a target embedding while **maximizing coherence** with individual modalities.

**Loss Function:**
```
Loss = α * MSE(Wisp, Target) + β * (1 - mean(Coherence))
```

**Training Data:**
- 18,884 samples across 4 categories
- Personal memory: 4,721 samples
- Creative fiction: 4,721 samples
- Conversational dialogue: 4,721 samples
- Technical documentation: 4,721 samples

**Training Configuration:**
- 8 epochs
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Hardware: 5x RTX 5090 GPUs

### 6. **Wisp as Identity Anchor**

**Principle:** The fused Wisp is not just a vector - it is an **identity anchor** that can be used for:
- Authentication (Logos)
- Semantic search (finding similar identities)
- Coherence validation (SAGE)
- Temporal tracking (Kronos)

**Properties of a Valid Wisp:**
1. **Coherent**: High similarity with all input modalities
2. **Stable**: Consistent across multiple compositions of the same identity
3. **Distinctive**: Low similarity with Wisps from different identities
4. **Composable**: Can be decomposed back into constituent modalities

---

### 7. **Attention Pattern Analysis**

**Principle:** The **attention weights** reveal how the model understands identity composition.

**What to Visualize:**
- Attention heatmap: Which modalities attend to which others
- Head specialization: What each attention head learns
- Category differences: How attention patterns vary by category

**Expected Patterns:**
- Personal memory: Narrative ↔ Temporal strong attention
- Creative fiction: Modal ↔ Narrative strong attention
- Technical docs: Role ↔ Modal strong attention
- Conversational: All modalities balanced attention

## Visual Representation Strategy

### Viewport 1: Real-Time Fusion Visualization
**Concept:** Show the **process** of fusion, not just the result

**Elements:**
1. **Four Input Orbs** (one per modality)
   - Color-coded: Narrative (blue), Modal (green), Temporal (orange), Role (purple)
   - Size represents embedding magnitude
   - Pulsing animation during composition

2. **Attention Flow Lines**
   - Animated lines connecting modalities
   - Thickness = attention weight
   - Color = attention head
   - Flow direction shows information transfer

3. **Central Wisp Formation**
   - Starts as empty sphere
   - Fills with color as fusion progresses
   - Final color is blend of all modalities
   - Glow intensity = coherence score

4. **Multi-Head Attention Display**
   - 8 small circles around the Wisp
   - Each represents one attention head
   - Color shows which modalities the head emphasizes
   - Size shows head contribution to final Wisp

## Next Steps

1. Design the visual language (colors, animations, layouts)
2. Define scribe_presentation.yaml ontology

5. Write complete research report
6. Integrate and test

This analysis provides the **semantic foundation** for building a presentation that renders from meaning, not from templates.
